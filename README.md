# 🔥 Fire Detection System using IR Sensor and Arduino

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a simple and effective *Fire Detection System* built using an *IR sensor, **Arduino UNO, **16x2 LCD display, and a **buzzer*. It continuously monitors infrared radiation and alerts the user through visual (LCD) and audio (buzzer) signals when fire is detected.

## 🛠 Features

- 🚨 Fire detection based on IR radiation levels.
- 📟 Real-time status display on a 16x2 LCD.
- 🔊 Audio alert via buzzer when fire is detected.
- ✅ Simple, low-cost, and beginner-friendly project.

## 🔌 Circuit Connections

| Arduino Pin | Component         |
|-------------|-------------------|
| A0 (or change in code) | IR Sensor Output |
| 8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 7 | LCD RS, E, D4–D7 |
| 10          | Buzzer            |
| 5V, GND     | Power Supply      |

> ⚠ *Note: The IR sensor should be connected to an **analog pin*, e.g., A0, since analogRead() is used.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The IR sensor detects infrared light from flames and outputs an analog signal.
2. If the IR value is *below a set threshold* (default 800), the system identifies this as a potential fire.
3. In fire condition:
   - LCD shows Fire detected
   - Buzzer sounds
4. If no fire is detected:
   - LCD shows Standby
   - Buzzer remains silent
