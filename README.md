# ðŸ”¥ Fire Detection System using IR Sensor and Arduino

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project is a simple and effective *Fire Detection System* built using an *IR sensor, **Arduino UNO, **16x2 LCD display, and a **buzzer*. It continuously monitors infrared radiation and alerts the user through visual (LCD) and audio (buzzer) signals when fire is detected.

## ðŸ§° Components Used

| Component         | Quantity | Description                                 |
|------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Arduino UNO       | 1        | Microcontroller                             |
| IR Flame Sensor   | 1        | Detects fire based on infrared radiation    |
| 16x2 LCD Display  | 1        | Displays system status                      |
| Buzzer            | 1        | Provides audio alert                        |

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Connections

| Arduino Pin | Component         |
|-------------|-------------------|
| A0 (or change in code) | IR Sensor Output |
| 8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 7 | LCD RS, E, D4â€“D7 |
| 10          | Buzzer            |
| 5V, GND     | Power Supply      |

> âš  *Note: The IR sensor should be connected to an **analog pin*, e.g., A0, since analogRead() is used.

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. The IR sensor detects infrared light from flames and outputs an analog signal.
2. If the IR value is *below a set threshold* (default 800), the system identifies this as a potential fire.
3. In fire condition:
   - LCD shows Fire detected
   - Buzzer sounds
4. If no fire is detected:
   - LCD shows Standby
   - Buzzer remains silent
