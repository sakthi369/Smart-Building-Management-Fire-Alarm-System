GITHUB REPOSITORY LINK: https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Building-Management.git
________________________________________
Abstract:
The "IoT – Smart Building Management System" focuses on a fire detection unit that uses an infrared (IR) flame sensor to monitor flame presence in indoor environments. It is designed as a safety mechanism in smart buildings to provide early fire warnings and help prevent property damage and loss of life. The system integrates a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) for real-time status updates and a buzzer (speaker) for audible alerts. It demonstrates a cost-effective, modular solution for automated fire monitoring in smart buildings.

1. Project Demonstration

Overview:
This prototype demonstrates fire detection using an IR sensor. It displays current status on an LCD and activates an audible alarm upon detecting fire.

Demonstration Details:
• Sensor Input:
    o IR Flame Sensor (Analog): Detects infrared radiation from flames.
    o Analog value is read and compared to a threshold.

• Output and Alerts:
    o LCD Display (16x2): Shows “Fire detected” or “Standby”.
    o Speaker: Emits a tone (1000 Hz) when fire is detected.

System Components:
• Arduino Uno
• IR Flame Sensor (connected to analog pin A2 or digital pin 2)
• LCD 16x2 (pins 4–9)
• Buzzer/Speaker (pin 10)
• Jumper wires, Breadboard

Performance Metrics:
• Detection delay: ~1 second
• Audible and visual alerts upon detection
• Low power usage; ideal for embedded building systems

Outcome:
• Functional fire detection prototype
• Modular and easily extensible with additional sensors (gas, smoke, temperature)

3. Feedback and Final Adjustments

Overview:
Peer and mentor reviews helped refine display clarity, alert speed, and code simplicity.

Feedback Highlights:
• Increase contrast of LCD backlight for visibility
• Delay between status transitions
• Debounce IR sensor fluctuation

Refinements Implemented:
• Added 1-second delay to allow message display
• Smoothed transition with `lcd.clear()` before each update
• Clear code formatting and logic flow

Outcome:
• Final version stable and readable
• Easy for beginners to understand and extend
